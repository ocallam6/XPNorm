    "In the first paper, and in all other dust maps which are generated via reddenning, the extinction is calculated via a stellar model $\\vec{x}=M(\\vec \\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is a set of stellar parameters. $M(\\vec \\theta)$ is usually an isochrone model or some data-driven color-magnitude relations. These are coupled with priors on the stellar parameters to get a posterior distribution over the extinction $A_0$."

Moreover, error on the extinction estimate arises from the length of the intersection of the extinction vector $\\vec A$ which stems from the observed point, intersecting with the 'zero-extinction manfiold' given by the surface $M(\\vec \\theta)$.

    "They begin by selecting ∼1 million stars with E(B−V)SFD < 0.1mag, detections in all PS1 and 2MASS passbands, and photometric errors less than 0.5mag in every passband. The resulting sample has a median reddening of 0.016mag in E(B−V). After dereddening the photometry, we fit a stellar locus in 7- dimensional color space, using the algorithm laid out in Newberg & Yanny (1997). The resulting stellar locus is plotted in Fig. 17."
